# parsec
A C++ program that uses the basic concepts of c++ like file handling, structures etc. to build a file management system that is visualized in the form a school uniform shop billing system.
Download all the file present in this repositry and place them all in one folder or one place and then you must be having a gcc compiler to see this file management system for a shop that I have built.
The 2 .txt files are used to store the details of the products and the csfile.txt is the .txt file that has all that code written in one .txt page in case anyone want to copy and paste into a new file.
REMEMBER- password for admin is - 'nilesh' (without quotes) on the name of the programmer.
This project can be helpful to students who have just learned file handling and want to work on a project.
For a full documented project or file you can write to me.
